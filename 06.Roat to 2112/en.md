## The power to think about the future

—it's something both children and adults need.  
**"Road to 2112"** is a short story series that begins with a simple question:  
**“What if this kind of future actually came true?”**

Each story explores a theme connected to our future—AI, the environment, education, urban life, and more—  
all presented in a standalone, easy-to-read format.  
Though short, each story is deep and thought-provoking, encouraging readers to see the future as **a personal matter**.
