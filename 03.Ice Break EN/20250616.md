Recently, I’ve been fortunate to receive a steady flow of OEM inquiries,  
and I continue to work on proposals and production of custom merchandise and novelty items.  
Having been involved in this field since founding my business, I consider myself a pro when it comes to this kind of work.

Lately, I’ve also launched an English-language media platform for a project called _Bonfilet_ — a message-woven bracelet designed to connect people emotionally.  
Feel free to check out [SasakiyaShoten](https://sassamahha.me/en), where I share AI-related trend analysis and insights on merchandising (MD).

At the same time, between the day-to-day production work,  
I’m also pursuing a long-term question:  
**"What do I want to leave behind in the next 10 years?"**

That’s where my project “Road to 2112” comes in.

It’s a future-oriented storytelling initiative where I collaborate with AI to generate fictional “what if” stories that could unfold between now and the year 2112.  
These stories are designed to spark conversations between children and their parents — and are published in multiple languages through KDP.

AI technologies are evolving at a pace that’s already beyond human tracking.  
But more important than “what AI can do” is the question of **“what we choose to use it for.”**

For me, turning that question into stories — and delivering them as everyday reading experiences — is what I see as the work of **laying tracks toward the future**.

The work I’m doing today, grounded in real-world production,  
and the new project building bridges to the future — both are essential.  
And that’s exactly why I’m choosing to move forward on **both wheels**, in my own way.
